          There are so many different JavaScript events happening, how does one possibly keep up with it all?
        </p>

        <p>
          That's what we're here for. We help the Toronto and surrounding communities learn, promote, schedule,
          host, record, share, and participate in front-end web related culture.
        </p>

        <p>
          We also host our own events every two weeks. Join us for a Tech Talk night, Hack night, and Pub night
          to get away from the restrictions of work and discuss the latest tech with fellow members.
        </p>

        <p>
          Toronto JavaScript is an entirely community run organization. We are developers
          managing a community for other developers.
