      <p>
        We're a community of JavaScript developers from Toronto, Canada.
      </p>

      <p>
        Every two weeks we get together for Tech Talk nights, Hack nights, and Pub nights
        to get away from the restrictions of work and discuss the latest tech with fellow
        members.
      </p>

      <p>
        Toronto JavaScript is an entirely community run organization. We are developers
        managing a community for other developers.
